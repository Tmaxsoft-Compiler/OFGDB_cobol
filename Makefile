# are dummy when toplevel bootstrap is not active.

# While making host and target tools, symlinks to the final stage must be
# there, so $(unstage) should be run at various points.  To avoid excessive
# recursive invocations of make, we "inline" them using a variable.  These
# must be referenced as ": $(MAKE) ; $(unstage)" rather than "$(unstage)"
# to avoid warnings from the GNU Make job server.

# the previous stage to a constant name ('prev-gcc'), and to make the name of
# the build directories constant as well. For the latter, we use naked names
# like 'gcc', because the scripts in that directory assume it.  We use
# mv on platforms where symlinks to directories do not work or are not
# reliable.

# --------------------------------------
# Dependencies between different modules
# --------------------------------------

# Generic dependencies for target modules on host stuff, especially gcc



# There are two types of dependencies here: 'hard' dependencies, where one
# module simply won't build without the other; and 'soft' dependencies, where
# if the depended-on module is missing, the depending module will do without
# or find a substitute somewhere (perhaps installed).  Soft dependencies
# are made here to depend on a 'maybe-' target.  If you're not sure,
# it's safer to use a soft dependency.






# With all the machinery above in place, it is pretty easy to generate
# dependencies.  Host dependencies are a bit more complex because we have
# to check for bootstrap/prebootstrap dependencies.  To resolve
# prebootstrap dependencies, prebootstrap modules are gathered in
# a hash table.
